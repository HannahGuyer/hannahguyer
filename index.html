            Whilst Radar is one of Melbourne’s newer venues, it occupies the space previously home to 25-year-running <em>Lounge Bar</em> which was recently obtained and given a makeover by the guys running Section  and a number of the city’s other best music establishments. With a new Function One sound system, state of the art lighting rigs, outdoor smokers that looks down onto bustling Swanston Street and drink specials throughout the week, its no wonder the venue attracts crowd of both Lounge loyal’s and new fans. The open indoor space has previously hosted art collectives like Synesthetic and remains an ideal space for sculptural art, projections and has been known to accomodate merch tables on the covered balcony.

         A long standing champion in Melbourne’s nightlife and electronic music scene, Revolver’s walls feature a number of permanent works by renowned local and international artists. Along with supporting upcoming musicians, Revs also hosts a range of events ranging from yoga classes to speed dating. Creative events are hosted in both outdoor and indoor spaces and features a mural wall. It makes sense that such a versatile and dynamic space can also transformed into an art exhibition space, suited best for art that is vibrant and interactive, such as projection art, sculpture and printed art.

            Colour is a 24-hour nightclub housed in a former church built in 1835 that, over the course of its life, has also been home to the notorious ’90s S&M club Hellfire, and the short-lived club Yours & Mine.
<br>
 On the ground floor are the main bar, freshly installed plywood booths and the club dance floor. Red pyramids of light shine down on a room that shudders with bass from the newly installed, industry-best Funktion-One sound system. But Colour isn’t just for DJs. Head upstairs past the smokers area and you’ll find the band room where every surface apart from the floor is painted in a bright, lurid orange. Here lies the potential for exhibition space, while downstairs serves as a performance area (RMIT recently held their Honours Fashion grad show here.)

Upstairs, the venue is split into two areas divided by a short corridor with one side acting as a music stage and the adjoined by a room suitable size for a gallery space. This makes the Grace Darling perfect for musicians wanting to collaborate with visual artists.
